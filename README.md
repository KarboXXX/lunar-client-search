# Lunar Client on Search.
## First impressions.
First of all, you need to run this script as root, so the script can make changes on your `/usr/share/applications` folder. If you want to change the Lunar Client icon, just delete the `lunar-client.png` to your custom one, with the same name before running the script.

## Installation.
As said before, run all commands with sudo to prevent erros!
And do not forget to install LunarClient AppImage from the [official website](https://www.lunarclient.com/download/), and rename it to `LunarClient.AppImage` so the script can find it automaticaly.
```
git clone https://github.com/KarboXXX/lunar-client-search.git
cd lunar-client-search
```
For now, as it not requiring any python3 packages that are not default, its non existent and `requirements.txt` file, so run it as normal using `python3 lunar.py`

# Ok, why tho?
I had nothing better to do, and its 05:36 AM here in brazil as now, and i have insomnia.
